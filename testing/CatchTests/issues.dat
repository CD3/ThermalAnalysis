Research:
Start using the notebook
Write up monthly report
Keep issues AND progress/questions in notebook
Postprocessing interpolators, have some reason to choose one over other.
*Make printing results into a method, and have some way to accomplish comparing values without having to read from results
improving interpolators, enter extra 0 values at the beginning?
switch profiles to pointers A[i] = *A + i : save processing time

Questions:
  should the "build" method blow out previous added from memory
  I have them as "references" but I don't know if any actual changes have been made
  I have the title linearcombinator/linearcombination wrong in the header
